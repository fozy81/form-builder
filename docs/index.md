# Welcome
  WayOway is a simple way to plan data gathering for your research project.
  Create a project, add the items you need and the forms you need to
  complete. Then monitor and update your project as it progresses.

  We intentionally kept its functionality, design and code to a minimum,
  so we can focus on building robust foundations for your project. This
  allows you to build custom features on top.

  WayOway gives you a flexible structure to build your research project
  upon and can handle  many different types of data. For example, you can
  collect respones, samples, questionaires, surveys, specimens, locations,
  images etc in both remote (offline) locations or in the lab.

  For physical samples, you can print labels and keep track of your samples
  as they pass through your analysis processes.

 WayOway uses the Hoodie javascript framework and implements all its features for you:

<ul>
  <li>Add, update, remove and find data</li>
  <li>Create an account, Login, Sign out, destroy account</li>
  <li>Reset password</li>
  <li>Change Username and Password</li>
</ul>

  Your data is held in a couchdb based database. Allowing access directly via a web api or via a python or R libraries.
