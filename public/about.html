      <h2>What is WayOway?</h2>

      <p>
        WayOway is a simple way to plan data gathering for your research project.
        Create a project, add the items you need and the forms you need to
        complete. Then monitor and update your project as it progresses.

        We intentionally kept its functionality, design and code to a minimum,
        so we can focus on building robust foundations for your project. This
        allows you to build custom features on top.

        WayOway gives you a flexible structure to build your research project
        upon and can handle  many different types of data. For example, you can
        collect respones, samples, questionaires, surveys, specimens, locations,
        images etc in both remote (offline) locations or in the lab.

        For physical samples, you can print labels and keep track of your samples
        as they pass through your analysis processes.
