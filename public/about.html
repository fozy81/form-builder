        Form builder is a simple application to demostrate more advanced features of Hoodie.
        It is based on the starter app 'Hoodie Tracker'. It implements all the features of Hoodie gives you for free:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Add, update, remove and find data</li>
        <li>Create an account, Login, Sign out, destroy account</li>
        <li>Reset password</li>
        <li>Change Username and Password</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We intentionally kept its functionality, design and code to a minimum,
        so you can use it as a starting point for your own app! Here’s a blog
        post on
        <a href="https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/issues/71">

      <h3>
        Hoodie Camp Release
      </h3>

      <p><img src="/assets/hoodie-camp.png" alt="Illustration of a campsite with a modest tent" class="hoodie-camp"></p>

      <p>
        Form builder is using the latest Hoodie Version which we call
        “Camp Release”. The idea is Hoodie, as a product, is not ready. It’s
        like a tent, while providing shelter, it’s a tarp some sticks and lines,
        not too comfortable, but it gets the job done for a couple of nights.
        But the Hoodie Camp is less about the product (the tent),
        and more about the experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        And if you run into a problem, we would love to help you fix the tent
        yourself :) We put endless efforts to make Hoodie as friendly as
        possible towards to contributors like yourself. For example, we curate a
        list of
        <a href="http://go.hood.ie/hoodie-starter-issues">
          great starter issues
        </a>,
        but you can
        <a href="http://hood.ie/contribute/">
          contribute much more than just code
